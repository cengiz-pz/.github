# Security

This document outlines the default procedures suggested for SDK integrations
for Godot.

SDK maintainers can override this policy with their own `SECURITY.md` file to
further specify how they wish to receive security vulnerability reports.

## Reporting security vulnerabilities

### Godot vulnerability

If you've found a security vulnerability in Godot itself, please do not
create an issue on the GitHub issue tracker as it will be visible publicly.

Instead, send an email to <security@godotengine.org>.

### SDK integration vulnerability

If you've found a security vulnerability in a community-maintained SDK for
Godot, please review that SDK's `MAINTAINERS.md` file for contact details
of the current maintainers, and send them a private email to disclose the
vulnerability.
