# Godot Engine Community SDK Integrations Repository

This repository includes [default community health files](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/creating-a-default-community-health-file)
and the organization's profile README.

Maintainers of SDK integrations hosted in this organization are welcome to
further specify their own policies by adding their own community health
files, as long as the requirement to follow the Godot
[Code of Conduct](https://godotengine.org/code-of-conduct) is kept.
